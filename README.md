## 🛡️ Sovereign Reliability for Autonomous Systems

StillUp is a **lightweight, privacy-first Safety Layer** for background jobs, AI agents, and homelab automation. It ensures that retrying failed systems is always safe by preventing duplicate side effects and providing exactly-once execution.

### ✨ Key Sovereign Features

StillUp provides the "Safety Primitives" needed for high-stakes autonomous systems:

- 🛡️ **ReplayGuard™ (Exactly-Once Execution)**: Prevent duplicate side effects (double payments, double emails, redundant API calls) during retries with cryptographic fingerprinting.
- 🛰️ **Infrastructure Memory**: StillUp tracks every side effect, handshake, and heartbeat. It provides a "Decision Engine" for your jobs: *Has this already happened? Should I skip it?*
- 🤖 **Agent Protection**: Dedicated SDK wrappers to protect high-cost LLM generations and agentic actions from non-deterministic failures.
- 🛠️ **Automated Rollbacks**: Register compensation hooks (`onRollback`) that trigger automatically when jobs fail, ensuring state consistency across complex autonomous runs.
- 🌐 **Webhook Sentinel**: Centralized visibility for all outbound communications, ensuring idempotency and security for your integration layer.
- 🎨 **Sentinel Hub**: A premium, glassmorphic command center to visualize your "Execution Memory" and homelab health.

## 💻 StillUp CLI (Local-First)

The CLI is the fastest way to monitor your local infrastructure:

```bash
# Point to your local instance
stillup login --url http://localhost:3000 --key YOUR_KEY

# Pulse a heartbeat (Cron/Job Monitoring)
stillup hb your-monitor-token

# Monitor a secure tunnel (Tunnelight Engine)
stillup tunnel monitor your-tunnel-token --target 10.0.0.1
```

## 🚀 Sovereign Quick Start (Docker)

The fastest way to deploy StillUp is via Docker.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StillUp/StillUp.git && cd StillUp

# 2. Launch the stack
docker-compose up -d
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access your local Sentinel Hub.

### Alternative: Manual Install

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set your DATABASE_URL and MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

### 3. Initialize Database
```bash
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:generate
```

### 4. Launch Intelligence
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the dashboard.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

StillUp is designed with a "Secure by Default" philosophy:
- **Zero Plaintext Secrets**: Webhook URLs and tokens are encrypted with industry-standard AES-256-GCM.
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular control over who can modify your infrastructure.
- **Audit Trails**: Every login, deletion, and configuration change is logged for compliance.
